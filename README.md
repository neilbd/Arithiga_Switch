# Arithiga_Switch

Arithiga is a variation of the game Galaga where you shoot a series of numbers and operators to get the given number at the top
of the screen. The numbers used range from 1-9 and the given operators are +, -, *, /, and ^ (representing addition, subtraction,
multiplcation, division, and the power symbol, respectively). You get 100 points for getting the number using 1 or 2 operators, 50 for using 3-5 operators, and 25 for any number
of operators using afterwards. For instance, if the given number is 8, you get more points for shooting 4, +, then 4 
than 2, +, 2, +, 2, +, then 2. This accumulated number also carries over to the next given number. If the next number happens to 
be 24, the player starts out with 8 from the previous number.

The player has three lives. Each life is reduced when the ship is hit by a number or operator symbol. For every hit, the
number accumulated up to that point turns back to 0. Once all three lives are gone, the game ends.

This version of the game allows customization options for your the type of ship used, the font and color of the numbers, and
the type and color of laser used, and more. The player does not have control of the ship. Rather, the ship automatically
alternates between a set of three numbers, followed by a set of three operators. Once the player knows the number or
operator he/she wants, the player presses the space bar to choose it. This mode of play style is designed for switch
users.
